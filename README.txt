Algorizer by Lazar Mancic

Algorizer is algorithm visualizer web site, which currently have visualizer for Searching, Sorting and Pathfinding Algorithms.

Searching Algorithms
- Select the algorithm which you want to visualize.
- Enter the size of array and click on Create Random Array or Create Sorted Array to create random or sorted array.
- Enter number which you want to search in array and click Start to visualize the algorithm.

Sorting Algorithms
- Select the algorithm which you want to visualize.
- Enter the size of array and click on Create Random Array to create array which algorithm will sort.
- Click on Start to visualize the algorithm.

Pathfinding Algorithms
- Select the algorithm which you want to visualize.
- If you want to generate random maze, click on button for that.
- Clear board will clear the board.
- There are three radio buttons for Start, End and Wall Node.
- If we click on board field, selected node will be placed.
- Click on Start to visualize the algorithm.

Important: Don't change algorithm when you stop one, but you can change speed or reset board/columns.
